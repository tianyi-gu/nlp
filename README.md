In a time where many menial jobs are being automated away, the ability to communicate effectively and efficiently is more important than ever before. While jobs that are easy to perform increasingly become replaced by machines, jobs that require the ability to communicate with others are essential and irreplaceable. Using NLP, or Natural Language Processing, computer programs have the ability to analyze and learn about natural, or human, languages. Using NLP, I created a Python program that can take in audio, video, or text, and compare it to a chosen role model speaker. From there, the program informs the user about characteristics and factors that affect their manner of speech. This includes polarity, subjectivity, vocabulary, frequency, <br>words per minute, among others. Using this information, the user can learn how to emulate a role model they admire. My program can be used to improve communication levels in people. Many individuals lack necessary communication skills such as public speaking, which my solution helps remedy. My design provides an easy and accessible way for people in search of a way to improve their communication skills to do so.
